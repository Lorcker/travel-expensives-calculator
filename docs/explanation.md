This part of the project documentation focuses on an
**understanding-oriented** approach.

I created this program in order to make a computer do the infeasible task of disturbing travel expenses among a group. The approach this program takes is based on a bank principle:

The program calculates the Transactions by selecting the member with the most expenses as 'bank'. Everybody who is not the bank will pay or receive money from/to the bank. This approach will result in max. 1 transaction per non-bank member. The total amount of transaction will not be larger than the size of the group. [Approach suggested by Christian Junginger]
